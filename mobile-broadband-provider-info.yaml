Description: |
    This package contains mobile broadband settings for different service providers
    in different countries. The Package contains only informational files so it's
    safe for distributions to grab updates even during feature freeze and
    maintenance stages.
    
    When you want to configure a mobile broadband connections there usually is some
    service provider specific information you have to know before the connection
    can be established. Problem with this information is that it's highly technical
    for an ordinary consumer and it's available only from service providers web
    page or from Microsoft Windows installation media that becomes with tie-in
    subscription devices.
    
    The interesting side of this information is that it's the same for every user
    of a given service provider. This means that service provider specific 
    information can be stored in a database. When this database is available the
    information can be fetched there and the ordinary user does not need to bother
    about it. 
    
    Service provider specific information is stored in a XML file. XML is not the
    most optimized format for a database, but it's easy to read, understand and
    edit.
    
    The database is released under Creative Commons Public Domain (CC-PD).
